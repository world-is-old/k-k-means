# k-k-means
First attempt at Kotlin multi-platform project. 

This is an implementation of KMeans algorithm in cross-platform way. JVM and LinuxX64 implementations were made.

These are provided in single thread and parallel variants to take a look at concurrency mechanics provided by Kotlin (Native)

Subject to many possible optimizations.
